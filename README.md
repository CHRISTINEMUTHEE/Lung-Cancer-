# Lung-Cancer-
Lung cancer is by far the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women, making up almost 25% of all cancer deaths.
Globally Cancer has proved to be the most dangerous killer with cases ever increasing with time.


#                                        Proposed solution.

To build a model that can assess the length of stay that treatment procedures take in order to help hospitals channel their resources and patients plan accordingly, as well as to assess the outcome of cancer patients after discharge from the hospital following various treatment procedures using machine learning.


# Justification.
We seek to carry out this research to investigate the severity and effectiveness of the treatments that these patients are exposed to while assessing the discharge outcome as a prognosis.
- The aim of this is to have an optimum way of treating cancer patients that guarantees life after discharge.
- The project will be beneficial to hospitals and researchers by giving effective treatment paths for patients with varying    stages of lung cancer. 
By assessing the duration of post operative and total hospital stay , we can find out the types of surgeries that help hospitals plan the logistics involved accordingly thus reducing unnecessary traffic. This will also help patients and hospitals avoid accumulation of bills(as they are charged per duration of stay) .
When a hospital has a higher reputation of effective treatment , patients and relatives trust  that the institution offers a safer clinical environment. Given the increasing public awareness of clinical errors, hospitals that adopt this research will have a better chance of boosting public trust thus increasing the number of patients which is their main clientele and thus maximizing profits.
We also seek to benchmark the treatments found in poland and compare it to the individual charges right here in kenya to understand how hospitals can channel their resources accordingly to fit optimum treatment options and avoid wastage.

# Main objectives.

- To assess the duration of stay that treatment procedures take to help hospitals  channel their resources and patients to     plan accordingly.
- To assess the outcome of the cancer patients after discharge from the hospital following various treatment procedures.
